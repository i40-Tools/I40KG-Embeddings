  "A Reference Architecture describes the structure of a system with its element types and their structures, as well as their interaction types, among each other and with their environment. Describing this, a Reference Architecture defines restrictions for an instantiation (concrete architecture). Through abstraction from individual details, a Reference Architecture is universally valid within a specific domain. Further architectures with the same functional requirements can be constructed based on the reference architecture. Along with reference architectures comes a recommendation, based on experiences from existing developments as well as from a wide acceptance and recognition by its users or per definition.

Its members are primarily international car manufacturers, suppliers and engineering service providers from the automotive industry. The association coordinates the development of technical standards, which are developed by working groups composed of experts from its member companies. ASAM pursues the vision that the tools of a development process chain can be freely interconnected and allow a seamless exchange of data. The standards define protocols, data models, file formats and application programming interfaces (APIs) for the use in the development and testing of automotive electronic control units. A large amount of popular tools in the areas of simulation, measurement, calibration and test automation are compliant to ASAM standards. Compliance shall guarantee interoperability of tools from different vendors, allow data exchange without the need for converters, and facilitate the exchange of unambiguous specification between customers and suppliers.": 384,
