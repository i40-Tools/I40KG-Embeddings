## Abstract

> Industry 4.0 (I4.0) standards and standardization frameworks have been proposed with the goal of empowering interoperability in smart factories.
These standards enable the description and interaction of the main components, systems, and processes inside of a smart factory.
Due to the increasing number of I4.0 frameworks and standards, there is an increasing need in the industry for approaches that automatically analyze the landscape of I4.0 standards. 
The fact that standardization frameworks classify standards according to their functions into layers and dimensions produces interoperability conflicts between standards.
Describing the I4.0 landscape in knowledge graphs alleviates these interoperability problems.
However, performing traditional graph analysis still requires significant domain knowledge.
In this work, we study the relatedness among standards and frameworks based on community analysis to discover knowledge that helps us to cope with interoperability conflicts between standards.
We use knowledge graph embeddings to create these communities automatically exploiting the meaning of the relationships among standards.
In particular, we focus on the identification of groups of standards that are similar, i.e., communities of standards, and analyze their properties to uncover relations between them.
We empirically evaluate our approach on a knowledge graph of I4.0 standards using the Trans family of embedding models for knowledge graph entities.
Our results indicate the benefits of a knowledge-driven approach for unveiling novel properties of the I4.0 standards landscape.


## Software implementation

> Briefly describe the software that was written to produce the results of this
> paper.

The data used in this study are provided in `embeddings` and `test_set`.
Results generated by the code are saved in `accuracy`, `density_plot` and `evaluation_metric`.
See the `README.md` files in each directory for a full description.


## Getting the code

## Dependencies
You'll need a working Python environment to run the code.
The required dependencies are specified in the file `requirements.txt`.
The libraries indicated in the above file must be installed using the pip or the package manager of the operating system.

## Content

* experiment.py:  This script load the input data and create the communities. 5-fold cross validation in the experiment is used. The input required are the embeddings training set. The output of each training set is in the folder `clustering_measures`. We combine three community detection algorithms with four embedding algorithms.

* density_plot_standard_similarity.py:  Plot the probability density for each five-fold and embedding algorithm.

* clustering_measures/execute_metrics.py:  Clustering Measures App (CMA). This script call `CMA` App, This program computes the clusterings measures for the communities obtained. See the `Readme.txt`.

* evaluation_metric.py:  Plot the quality of the generated communities. A radar plot is computed with 5 metrics for the result of three community detection algorithms. For each embedding algorithms a radar plot is computed.

* community_analysis.py :  Plot the quality of the generated communities. Percentage of the test set for the property \texttt{sto:relatedTo} is achieved in each cluster. 


## Reproducing the results
