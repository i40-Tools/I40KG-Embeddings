  "\"Extensibility could be a huge challenge at the edge of the network, unlike a mobile system, the things in the IoT could be very dynamic. When the owner purchases a new thing, can it be easily added to the current service without any problem? Or when one thing is replaced due to wearing out, can the previous service adopt a new node easily? These problems should be solved with a flexible and extensible design of service management layer in the edgeOS.\"": 16,
  "\"Isolation would be another issue at the edge of the network. In mobile OS, if an application fails or crashes, the whole system will usually crash and reboot. Or in a distributed system the shared resource could be managed with different synchronization mechanisms such as a lock or token ring. \"": 17,

These processes can impact the cost and revenue generation of an organization. As a policy-making approach, BPM sees processes as important assets of an organization that must be understood, managed, and developed to announce value-added products and services to clients or customers. This approach closely resembles other total quality management or continual improvement process methodologies and BPM proponents also claim that this approach can be supported, or enabled, through technology.

The common characteristics most interpretations share are on-demand scalability of highly available and reliable pooled computing resources, secure access to metered services from nearly anywhere, and displacement of data and services from inside to outside the organization. While aspects of these characteristics have been realized to a certain extent, cloud computing remains a work in progress. This publication provides an overview of the security and privacy challenges pertinent to public cloud computing and points out considerations organizations should take when outsourcing data, applications, and infrastructure to a public cloud environment.": 691,
  "Cloud computing is a type of Internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers that may be located far from the user\u2013ranging in distance from across a city to across the world. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over an electricity network. (source: wikipedia)": 692,

The CoRE group has proposed the following features for CoAP: RESTful protocol design minimizing the complexity of mapping with HTTP, Low header overhead and parsing complexity, URI and content-type support, Support for the discovery of resources provided by known CoAP services. Simple subscription for a resource, and resulting push notifications, Simple caching based on max-age. (source: https://www.postscapes.com/internet-of-things-protocols/)": 695,

  "In reliability theory and reliability engineering, the term availability has the following meanings: * The degree to which a system, subsystem or equipment is in a specified operable and committable state at the start of a mission, when the mission is called for at an unknown, i.e. a random, time. Simply put, availability is the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. This is often described as a mission capable rate. Mathematically, this is expressed as 100% minus unavailability. * The ratio of (a) the total time a functional unit is capable of being used during a given interval to (b) the length of the interval. For example, a unit that is capable of being used 100 hours per week (168 hours) would have an availability of 100/168. However, typical availability values are specified in decimal (such as 0.9998). In high availability applications, a metric known as nines, corresponding to the number of nines following the decimal point, is used.

  "Software deployment is all of the activities that make a software system available for use. The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them. These activities can occur at the producer side or at the consumer side or both. Because every software system is unique, the precise processes or procedures within each activity can hardly be defined. Therefore, \"deployment\" should be interpreted as a general process that has to be customized according to specific requirements or characteristics. (source: wikipedia)": 3545,

The special conditions in a high voltage environment have to be taken into consideration.\nNote 1: Standards prepared by other technical committees of the IEC and organizations such as ITU and ISO shall be used where applicable.\nNote 2: Although the work of TC 57 is chiefly concerned with standards for electric power systems, these standards may also be useful for application by the relevant bodies to other geographical widespread processes.\nNote 3: Whereas standards related to measuring and protection relays and to the control and monitoring equipment used with these systems are treated by TC 95, TC 57 deals with the interface to the control systems and the transmission aspects for teleprotection systems. Whereas standards related to equipment for electrical measurement and load control are treated by TC 13, TC 57 deals with the interface of equipment for interconnection lines and industrial consumers and producers requiring energy management type interfaces to the control system.": 4005,

The standards provide systematic methods and tools for the dependability assessment and management of equipment, services and systems throughout their life cycles.\nThe standards cover generic aspects on reliability and maintainability programme management, testing and analytical techniques, software and system dependability, life cycle costing, technical risk analysis and project risk management. This includes standards related to product issues from component reliability to guidance for engineering dependability of systems, standards related to process issues from technological risk analysis to integrated logistics support and standards related to management issues from dependability program management to managing for obsolescence.\nThe application of these standards may raise safety related issues, though the standards themselves do not cover safety. They may be applied to business risk analysis but these risk areas are not dealt with by TC 56.": 4009,
