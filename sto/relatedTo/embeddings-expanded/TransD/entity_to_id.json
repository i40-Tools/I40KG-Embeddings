  "\"Extensibility could be a huge challenge at the edge of the network, unlike a mobile system, the things in the IoT could be very dynamic. When the owner purchases a new thing, can it be easily added to the current service without any problem? Or when one thing is replaced due to wearing out, can the previous service adopt a new node easily? These problems should be solved with a flexible and extensible design of service management layer in the edgeOS.\"": 16,
  "\"Isolation would be another issue at the edge of the network. In mobile OS, if an application fails or crashes, the whole system will usually crash and reboot. Or in a distributed system the shared resource could be managed with different synchronization mechanisms such as a lock or token ring. \"": 17,
  "'Things' in terms of physical objects in the IoT need to be described in order to identify them and to provide further information.": 18,

These processes can impact the cost and revenue generation of an organization. As a policy-making approach, BPM sees processes as important assets of an organization that must be understood, managed, and developed to announce value-added products and services to clients or customers. This approach closely resembles other total quality management or continual improvement process methodologies and BPM proponents also claim that this approach can be supported, or enabled, through technology.

  "Cloud computing can and does mean different things to different people. The common characteristics most interpretations share are on-demand scalability of highly available and reliable pooled computing resources, secure access to metered services from nearly anywhere, and displacement of data and services from inside to outside the organization. While aspects of these characteristics have been realized to a certain extent, cloud computing remains a work in progress. This publication provides an overview of the security and privacy challenges pertinent to public cloud computing and points out considerations organizations should take when outsourcing data, applications, and infrastructure to a public cloud environment.": 692,
  "Cloud computing is a type of Internet-based computing that provides shared computer processing resources and data to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., computer networks, servers, storage, applications and services), which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their data in third-party data centers that may be located far from the user\u2013ranging in distance from across a city to across the world. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economy of scale, similar to a utility (like the electricity grid) over an electricity network. (source: wikipedia)": 693,

The CoRE group has proposed the following features for CoAP: RESTful protocol design minimizing the complexity of mapping with HTTP, Low header overhead and parsing complexity, URI and content-type support, Support for the discovery of resources provided by known CoAP services.

  "In reliability theory and reliability engineering, the term availability has the following meanings: * The degree to which a system, subsystem or equipment is in a specified operable and committable state at the start of a mission, when the mission is called for at an unknown, i.e. a random, time. Simply put, availability is the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. This is often described as a mission capable rate. Mathematically, this is expressed as 100% minus unavailability. * The ratio of (a) the total time a functional unit is capable of being used during a given interval to (b) the length of the interval. For example, a unit that is capable of being used 100 hours per week (168 hours) would have an availability of 100/168. However, typical availability values are specified in decimal (such as 0.9998). In high availability applications, a metric known as nines, corresponding to the number of nines following the decimal point, is used. With this convention, \"five nines\" equals 0.99999 (or 99.999%) availability. (source: wikipedia)": 1742,

  "Service choreography is a form of service composition in which the interaction protocol between several partner services is defined from a global perspective.The intuition underlying the notion of service choreography can be summarised as follows: \u201cDancers dance following a global scenario without a single point of control\" That is, at run-time each participant in a service choreography executes its part of it (i.e. its role) according to the behavior of the other participants.A choreography's role specifies the expected messaging behavior of the participants that will play it in terms of the sequencing and timing of the messages that they can consume and produce.
